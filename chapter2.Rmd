# Chapter 2: Regression analysis

This week I did some data wrangling (*whew*) on the JYTOPKYS2 dataset and subsequently ran some descriptive analyses as well as multiple and simple regression analyses on the data. The conclusion of these analyses was that, according to this dataset, study attitudes affect the statistics course scores (points) statistically significantly (p < 0.001)

**Regression analysis**

*Step 1:*

I inspected the structure and dimensions of the learning2014 dataset I created in the data wrangling process.

str(learning2014)
dim(learning2014)

The data had 166 observations and 7 variables. The variables are: gender (of student), age (of student), attitude (general attitude towards statistics), deep (deep learning strategies), stra (strategic learning strategies), surf (surface learning strategies) and points (score of statistics course).

Next I commenced with installing necessary R packages and accessing them:

install.packages("ggplot2")

library(ggplot2)

install.packages("GGally")

library(GGally)

*Step 2:*

Next I drew a scatterplot matrix to explore a graphical overview of the data:

p <- ggpairs(learning2014, mapping = aes(col = gender), lower = list(combo = wrap("facethist", bins = 20)))

p

Here are some observations:
Age: Age is (as expected) heavily positively skewed (since the participants are students). Mean age is 25.5. Age does not correlate strongly with any of the other variables.  
Attitude: Attitude seems to be quite normally distributed, with slight negative skew. Attitude correlates moderately with points (r = 0.437). This is an interesting finding.  
Deep: Deep learning is quite neatly normally distributed. Deep learning has weak negative correlation (r = -0.324) with surface learning. This makes sense: when deep learning increases in a student, we can expect surface learning to decrease.  
Stra: Strategic learning has a nice normal distribution, but correlations with the other variables are at best very weak.  
Surf: Surface learning correlates very weakly with the other variables (nothing significant here) except for deep learning (See above).  
Points: (When greater than zero) points averaged (mean) at 22.7, with the lowest score being 7 and the highest 33. The points distribution is negatively skewed. The distribution peaks around it's mean, but also has a smaller peak around very high scores (around 30 points). Points have a moderate correlation with the attitude varialbe (r = 0.437).  

*Step 3:*

Next I fit three variables (attitudes, deep and surf) to a multiple linear regression model:

multiple_model <- lm(points ~ attitude + stra + surf, data = learning2014)

multiple_model

Here is a summary for this analysis:  

With the other variables constant, as attitudes increase with one (on a scale 0-5) points increase by ~3.4 (regression coefficient is 3.39). This is a highly significant relation (p < 0.001). The other variables (stra and surf) were not statistically significant (with respective p.values of 0.12 and 0.46 and regression coefficients of 0.85 and -0.57).

Multiple R-squared is 0.21. This implies that our model explains 21 % of the variance in points.

*Step 4:*

Since stra and surf were not significant, I chose to delete them form my model. This left me with a (nice) simple regression model with points as the dependent variable and attitude as the independent/explanatory variable:

![Simple Regression (Note: Scale of attitude here is 0-50, I was too lasy to fix it :)](C:\Users\RoopeOK\Documents\GitHub\IODS-project\Exercise2Regression.png)

The code for this was:

my_model <- lm(points ~ attitude, data = learning2014)

qplot(attitude, points, data = learning2014) + geom_smooth(method = "lm")

summary(my_model)

The regression coefficient rose to 0.35. p > 0.001, which means that the effect of attitude on points is very significant. Multiple R-squared is 0.19, implying that the variable attitude alone accounts for 19 % of the variance in student scores. F-statistic is 14.13 with 162 degrees of freedom.

What this does **NOT** imply is that attitudes *cause* high scores. There might be a third variable lurking behind attitudes towards statistics, such as general intelligence :-)

This is the coolest thing I've done with R so far, so I'm quite happy. Yay!


*Step 5:*

Moving towards diagnostics (shouldn't these be done *before* the regression analysis? Anyways...):




- Describe your work and results clearly. 
- Assume the reader has an introductory course level understanding of writing and reading R code as well as statistical methods
- Assume the reader has no previous knowledge of your data or the more advanced methods you are using
